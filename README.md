# Horn of Africa Aviary Project

A collaborative digital field guide for the birds of the Horn of Africa, combining ornithology with cultural and historical context.

## Purpose

This project aims to create a detailed, open‑source field guide that not only catalogs bird species found in the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and parts of Kenya and Sudan) but also documents their cultural significance, historical references, and local folklore. It is designed for bird enthusiasts, researchers, travelers, and anyone interested in the region's natural heritage.

## Structure

- **`species_entry_template.md`** – A standardized template for adding new bird species entries.
- **`entries/`** – Directory containing individual species files in Markdown format.
- **`README.md`** – This file, explaining the project and how to contribute.
- **Issues** – Used to track tasks such as adding new species or researching cultural notes.
- **Releases** – Periodic “editions” that bundle together a curated set of entries.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your addition.
2. **Use the template** (`species_entry_template.md`) to ensure consistent formatting.
3. **Add a new Markdown file** in the `entries/` folder, named after the bird's common name (e.g., `Secretarybird.md`).
4. **Fill in all sections**, especially the “Cultural Significance & Historical Notes” section.
5. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of the added entry.
6. **Open an Issue** if you have a research task or a suggestion for a new species.

## Roadmap

- **Version 1.0** – Foundational entries for three iconic species.
- **Future releases** – Expand to cover endemic, migratory, and culturally important birds.
- **Integration** – Potential inclusion of maps, audio recordings, and links to external resources.
