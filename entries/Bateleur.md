# Bateleur

**Scientific Name:** Terathopius ecaudatus  
**Conservation Status:** Endangered (IUCN Red List)  
**Family:** Accipitridae  
**Order:** Accipitriformes

## Identification

The bateleur is a medium‑sized eagle with a striking appearance. Adults have predominantly black plumage, a chestnut mantle, rump, and tail, and bright red facial skin, cere, and legs. The wings are long, broad, and distinctly bow‑shaped in flight; the tail is remarkably short, giving the bird a characteristic silhouette. Juveniles are brown with paler underparts and acquire adult plumage over 7–8 years. In flight, the bateleur rocks side‑to‑side with a dihedral wing posture, resembling a tightrope walker—hence its French name “bateleur.”

## Habitat & Distribution in the Horn of Africa

Bateleurs inhabit open savannas, dry woodlands, miombo and mopane forests, and thornveld with scattered trees for nesting. They avoid dense forests, deserts, and high mountains. In the Horn of Africa, they occur in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, and western Somalia, primarily in protected areas and savanna‑woodland mosaics. Suitable habitats include the Somali‑Masai bushland, Ethiopian highland savannas, and the dry acacia woodlands of the Ogaden.

## Behavior & Diet

Bateleurs are highly aerial, spending much of the day soaring low over the landscape. They are generalist predators and scavengers. Diet consists of mammals (55%), birds (24%), reptiles (18%), and occasionally fish and insects. They hunt live prey such as scrub hares, dik‑diks, hyraxes, and even jackals or honey badgers, sometimes taking prey heavier than themselves. They also scavenge carrion and frequently pirate food from other raptors (kleptoparasitism). Breeding pairs are territorial and build a large stick nest in a tree crown. Clutch size is usually one egg; incubation lasts about 55 days. Fledging occurs after 110–130 days. Reproductive success is low (about 0.47 chicks per nest annually), contributing to their vulnerable status.

## Cultural Significance & Historical Notes

The bateleur holds notable cultural importance across Africa. It is believed to be the inspiration for the “Zimbabwe Bird,” the national emblem of Zimbabwe that appears on the country’s flag. In Tswana mythology (Southern Africa) the bateleur is regarded as a wise servant to vultures. In East and Central Africa, local names include *gawarakko* and *nkona*. In the Lake Tanganyika region, the bird was considered a sacred possession of sultans.

Within the Horn of Africa, the bateleur is admired for its striking appearance and acrobatic flight. Although specific folklore from Somali, Ethiopian, or Eritrean traditions is less documented, its presence in local art and oral history is likely. Further research is needed to uncover stories, proverbs, or symbolic uses of the bateleur among the region’s diverse cultures.
