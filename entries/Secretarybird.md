# Secretarybird

**Scientific Name:** Sagittarius serpentarius  
**Conservation Status:** Endangered (IUCN 3.1, 2020)  
**Family:** Sagittariidae  
**Order:** Accipitriformes

## Identification

The secretarybird is a large, terrestrial bird of prey standing up to 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) tall, with crane‑like legs and a distinctive, flattened dark crest on the back of its head. Adults have grey plumage, black flight feathers and thighs, a featherless red‑orange face, and a hooked beak. The long central tail feathers give it an elegant silhouette. Sexes are similar, though females may be slightly smaller.

## Habitat & Distribution in the Horn of Africa

Secretarybirds inhabit open grasslands, savannas, and shrublands with grass under 0.5 m high, avoiding dense forests and true deserts. In the Horn of Africa they occur from eastern Ethiopia and Somalia southward into Kenya. They are found in semi‑arid acacia savannas and can be seen in protected areas such as the Awash National Park (Ethiopia) and the Somali‑Masai bushland ecoregion. They roost in thorny trees, especially Acacia species.

## Behavior & Diet

Primarily terrestrial, secretarybirds hunt on foot, walking at 2.5–3.0 km/h and delivering powerful stomps to kill prey. They are monogamous and defend territories of about 50 km². Breeding can occur year‑round, with a peak in the late dry season. Nests are large stick platforms built high in trees (2.5–13 m). Clutches contain 1–3 bluish‑green or white eggs; both parents share incubation (~45 days) and chick‑rearing. Fledging takes 65–106 days.

Diet includes insects (locusts, beetles), small vertebrates (rodents, frogs, lizards, snakes), and occasionally small birds or mammals. They are famous for their ability to kill venomous snakes.

## Cultural Significance & Historical Notes

The secretarybird is a prominent cultural symbol in several African nations. It appears on the coats of arms of both South Africa and Sudan, representing protection, national identity, and the state’s defense against enemies. Ancient depictions exist on a Naqada III‑era ivory knife handle from Upper Egypt (c. 3200 BC), suggesting a historical presence farther north than today.

Among ethnic groups in the Horn of Africa:
- The Maasai call it *ol‑enbai nabo* (“one arrow”) because its crest feathers resemble a quiver of arrows.
- The Xhosa regard it as highly intelligent.
- The Zulu name is *intungunono*.

The bird also appears on over 100 postage stamps from 37 countries, including many outside its natural range, highlighting its iconic status.
