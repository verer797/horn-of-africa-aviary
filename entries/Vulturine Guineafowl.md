# Vulturine Guineafowl

**Scientific Name:** Acryllium vulturinum  
**Conservation Status:** Least Concern (IUCN Red List)  
**Family:** Numididae  
**Order:** Galliformes

## Identification

The vulturine guinea fowl is the largest extant species of guinea fowl, measuring 61–71 cm (24–28 in) in length and weighing 1–1.6 kg. Its most striking features are a bare, bluish‑grey face and a long, bare neck that resembles a vulture—hence the name. The body is black with fine white spangling, and a cape of long, glossy blue and white hackles covers the upper back and breast. Sexes are similar, though females are slightly smaller and have smaller tarsal spurs. Juveniles are grey‑brown with duller plumage and shorter hackles.

## Habitat & Distribution in the Horn of Africa

This species inhabits dry savannas, open woodlands, and grasslands with scattered bushes and trees, typically in arid and semi‑arid regions. In the Horn of Africa, it is found in southern Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya (north of the equator), and northern Tanzania. It occurs in protected areas such as Samburu National Reserve (Kenya) and the Ogaden region of Ethiopia. The bird avoids dense forest and wetland habitats, preferring open, dry landscapes where it can roost in trees and find cover in thorny scrub.

## Behavior & Diet

Vulturine guineafowl are highly gregarious, forming flocks of about 25 individuals outside the breeding season. They are terrestrial and prefer to run rather than fly when alarmed. Their vocalizations include a loud, repetitive “chink‑chink‑chink” call. Breeding takes place in open, dry habitats; nests are well‑hidden grass‑lined scrapes on the ground, where 4–8 cream‑colored eggs are laid.

Diet is omnivorous and includes seeds, roots, tubers, insects (especially termites and beetles), grubs, small reptiles, rodents, and occasionally fruits and vegetation. They forage by scratching the ground with their feet.

## Cultural Significance & Historical Notes

The vulturine guineafowl is admired for its striking appearance and resilience in arid landscapes. In some East African cultures, its feathers are used in traditional adornments and crafts, and the bird may feature in local folklore as a symbol of adaptability. However, detailed accounts of its role in the folklore of Somali, Ethiopian, or Kenyan communities are not widely documented. Further research is needed to uncover specific myths, proverbs, or symbolic associations within the Horn of Africa.
